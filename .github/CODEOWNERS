# CODEOWNERS - Research-AI
# ============================================================================
# Every pull request requires approval from at least one code owner.
# Combined with branch protection rules, this ensures:
#   - No direct pushes to main (force push included)
#   - At least 2 approving reviews required
#   - Code owner approval is mandatory
#   - PR authors cannot approve their own PRs
# ============================================================================

# Default: all files owned by the full team
